# StatLog
For now the script just logs your keystrokes and sends you an email of every phrase you write (in later phases it'll send stats).

**HOW TO USE** 

Preferably with Python 2.7

    implement the receiver and sender email into their assigned places in the source code

run :

    py -2 log.py
    
in case you want to turn it into a windows executable : 

    py -2 -m PyInstaller --windowed --onefile log.py
    
## TO DO

- Update the log.py script to Python 3

- Statistics script

- User Interface
